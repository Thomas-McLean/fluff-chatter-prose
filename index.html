    <h1>To Make a Dadaist Poem</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a newspaper.</li>
      <li>Take a pair of scissors.</li>
      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>
      <li>
        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.
      </li>
      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.
      </li>
      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>
      <li>
        And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a
        sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the
        vulgar.

It seems obvious, right? I mean, if we had bags capable of holding things bigger than them, then we’d probably be well on our way to discovering other similarly fantastical things, like time travel and David Tennant. 
Don’t get me wrong, there are worse bags you could have. If I was (hypothetically) tasked with carrying a large, relatively heavy item, I’d rather have a backpack than a sandwich bag, or a purse. My backpack’s helped me carry plenty of things, big and small. But when you’ve only got an hour to transport a two-metre-tall ice sculpture over three suburbs, there are few objects that seem as useless as an old red canvas backpack.
